## Crypto-Info-App

Search for cryptocurrencies by relevant keywords and get information about them.

This app uses an API made by me called [Crypto-Info-API](https://crypto-info-api.herokuapp.com/) for fetching information about wide variety of decentralized blockchains/cryptocurrencies and smart contract platforms

The user can enter relevant keywords and will get the name of the cryptocurrency, link to the verified site and a short description about that cryptocurrency along with its ticker and link to the blockchain explorer.

The site is live at https://cryptoinfoapp.netlify.app/

[Crypto-Info-API](https://crypto-info-api.herokuapp.com/) allow developers to fetch informational content for a wide variety of decentralized blockchains/cryptocurrencies and smart contract platforms. 

## Optimizations
While improving this project, I would start by implementing the following features -

   1. Add support for multiple cryptocurrencies with same keywords
   2. Implement more API endpoints
              
## Lessons Learned
I leanrned how to develop an API, create a documentation for it and serve content when the API gets a request. I learned how to integrate a API into a project and how to manipulate the DOM using JavaScript to create a simple API based project. I learned about API management and how the API serves a request and how can it help in improving businesses.
